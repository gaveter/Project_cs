1. Normalize the loan_lenders table. In the normalized table, each row must have one loan_id and one lender.
2. For each loan, add a column duration corresponding to the number of days between the disburse time and the planned expiration time.
3. Find the lenders that have funded at least twice.
4. For each country, compute how many loans have involved that country as borrowers.
5. For each country, compute the overall amount of money borrowed.
6. Like the previous point, but expressed as a percentage of the overall amount lent.
7. Like the three previous points, but split for each year (with respect to disburse time).
8. For each lender, compute the overall amount of money lent.
9. For each country, compute the difference between the overall amount of money lent and the overall amount of money borrowed.
10. Which country has the highest ratio between the difference computed at the previous point and the population?
11. Which country has the highest ratio between the difference computed at point 9 and the population that is not below the poverty line?
12. For each year, compute the total amount of loans. Each loan that has planned expiration time and disburse time in different years must 
have its amount distributed proportionally to the number of days in each year. For example, a loan with disburse time December 1st, 2016,
 planned expiration time January 30th 2018, and amount 5000USD has an amount of 5000USD * 31 / (31+365+30) = 363.85 for 2016, 5000USD * 365 / (31+365+30) = 4284.04
for 2017, and 5000USD * 30 / (31+365+30) = 352.11 for 2018.
